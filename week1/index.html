            My Map!

            <p>As a critical digital map maker, I would like to spatially show relationships between communities and community colleges.
                The tl;dr version of my dissertation research is that community college libraries have archives but they're usually kind of hidden, maybe intentionally so.
                However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college">community colleges</a> are particularly interesting because they are literally situated in communities! Most community college students come from the communities in which the college is situated.
                Wouldn't it be cool if library/information workers partook in efforts to document community history? 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll be doing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study">case study</a> of a particular Central Valley community college where a professor is conducting oral histories with their students, documenting important Latinx and Filipinix farmworker history.
                For my methods, I was planning on using a thick map (something I learned while in the last cohort of the UCLA Urban Humanities Initiative) to show spatial relationships and layers of complex data points in this project.
                This professor also uses ArcGIS in their work already, too, so there is some meta-mapping going on.
            </p>

            <p>Here are the methods I'm using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thick map</li>
                <li>Interview</li>
                <li>Document analysis</li>
                <li>Participant observation</li>
            </ul>
           
            <br>
